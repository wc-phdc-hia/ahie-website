                                TIER.Net  is a software solution for digitising HIV, TB and Mother-Child Health (MCH) services, including the entire cascade from screening and diagnosis to treatment and outcomes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The priority objective of TIER is to monitor and improve patient management, clinical governance, staff workloads, and service delivery at the health facility.
                                The secondary objective being to cascade data through the health system from periphery to centre. Sub-districts, districts and provinces use and action different reports, as data requirements
                                and use for supervision and management vary at the different levels of health.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                TIER.Net is developed by the University of Cape Town (UCT) Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research (CIDER), with the first protoype built in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO)
                                and the Canadian International Devlopment Agency (CIDA).

                                The acronym TIER stands for Three Interlinked Electronic Registers. The first specification included the digitisation of the paper registers for the 3 health services (3ILPMS) prioritiesd by the WHO (HIV/ART, TB and MCH).
                                TIER has since been expanded to include TB case identification, DR-TB, TB prevention therapy (TPT) and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as well as minimal essential information around commorbidties.
                                TIER’s successful scale-up in the Western Cape brought on additional donors, including the Global Fund, MSF, CDC, USAID, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

                                TIER.Net is currently being used as a country system in South Africa and the Democratic Replublic of Congo, with smaller project-level implementations in Guinea, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Yemen and Sudan.
                                In South Africa, the application is being used in over 3500 public healthcare facilities, in addition to Correctional facilities and all health sub-districts and districts.
                                Language support includes English and French with the capability to add additional languages, if need be.

                            <p>
                                Data capture occurs at facility level and is dispatched and aggregated routinely to higher levels of health. The data are integrated with the district health information system (DHIS) for reporting various
                                programme data from sub-district to national levels. Reports from TIER fulfil case-based surveillance, donor funding and facility, district, province and national reporting requirements.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                TIER.Net is a Windows-based, standalone desktop application which maintains a unique record for the patient at facility level, recording patient data longitudinally. All data from the various episodes
                                for the patient is stored together, and reports can be drawn and actioned to facilitate improved patient management. At central level, data from unique individuals who attend multiple health facilities is
                                linked together to improve outcomes, health trends and health service performance.
                            </p>
                        
                            <p>
                                While TIER.Net continues to be a standalone system that can operate fully offline, an offline biased offline/online hybrid system has been developed using the OpenLHIM. When an internet/WAN connection exists and is
                                configured, TIER.Net is able to securely receive laboratory results in near real-time from centralized systems (e.g. National Health Laboratory Services) and push recently updated records to central databases using HL7 FHIR.
                                In the offline or hybrid online mode, TIER.Net can be networked locally on several computers in a health facility, sharing the same database.

                                <h5>HPRS - TIER.Net interoperability</h5>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                TIER.Net is an HIV and TB patient information system used from facility level through to national level in more than 3,500 facilities in South Africa.
                                The system had already been adapted to interoperate with standards-compliant patient master indices such as the HPRS.
                                Establishing consistent interoperability between HPRS and TIER.Net would ensure that the unique Health Patient Registration Number (HPRN) generated and held by HPRS was used as an identifier on TIER.Net.
                                This interoperability would demonstrate at scale that users of the health system who were registered on HPRS could be linked to nationally standardized patient information systems such as TIER.Net where appropriate.
                                Given the already wide existing footprint of TIER.Net, this would facilitate the rapid scaling up of interoperability components.

                            <p>
                                TIER.Net would be adapted to provide appropriate messaging to the PHDC via the OpenLHIM and similarly consume and integrate responses.
                                The anticipated result would be automatic integration of laboratory results into TIER.Net, the identification of encounters elsewhere for patients who were lost to follow-up and the submission of data about
                                clinical encounters more frequently than the current quarterly dispatching.
                                As part of the AHIE project, TIER.Net would be further extended to share clinical data bi-directionally, based on messaging standards.
                                The system would still be able to function in an offline environment but would also be able to benefit from connectivity where this was available, even if intermittently.
                                This enhancement would provide a valuable parallel approach to the development of fully online systems.

                                To improve the fidelity of facility-derived operational and patient management reports, laboratory results were critically needed in local instances of TIER.Net.
                                The reports would identify patients who required interventions, such as adherence interventions where viral loads were persistently elevated, or retention or re-engagement in care for patients
                                who had missed appointments or disengaged from TB or HIV care. It was anticipated that TIER.Net – NHLS interoperability, whether it was direct
                                (in the case of facilities that were online) or via the HIE would help mitigate one of the significant weaknesses of facility-based HIV and TB data, which was the failure to file,
                                record and capture laboratory results. Interoperability for this reference implementation would be via the HIE.
