                                The Reference African Health Information Exchange (AHIE) promotes the optimisation of patient healthcare through a replicable, context-appropriate health information exchange design.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                With a focus on person-level data, the design enables data capture as well as cascade reporting for individuals throughout their journey of disease management and care at clinician level, while allowing for aggregated data availability at a regional and national healthcare management level.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Key to the AHIE design is patient-level data harmonisation, data exchange and bi-directional interoperability between a set of matured health information technologies.

                                In late 2016 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded a grant to the University of Cape Town to establish a Reference African Health Information Exchange.
                                The aim of the project was to deliver a replicable and context-appropriate implementation of a health information exchange for clinical data working across
                                national and provincial health departments in South Africa.

                                In the South African health system, the national government provides policy, norms and standards, while personal health services are delivered by the provincial governments, and in some instances by large municipalities.

                                The federated health exchange model that this project sought to demonstrate would support this division of responsibility and services.
                                It would ensure that technologies, standards and tools were harmonised for national use, while supporting the management of patient-level information at the level where services are funded.

                                An anticipated outcome of this would be successful interoperability implementations for key systems that were critical to the country’s HIV and TB response.

                                To achieve these objectives of the AHIE project, a consortium of partners was brought together, in a collaboration which required the inclusion of particular expertise.
                                These partners were the CSIR, NDoH, NHLS, UCT CIDER, Jembi and PHDC.

                                care systems can come together in a virtuous community of practice.

                                In terms of the technologies, architecture, workflows and data science approaches which would be required for the reference health information exchange, the AHIE project identified the following key deliverables:

                                    <li>
                                        Although a lot that can be done in the absence of a single Unique Health Identifier, it is an important building block when working with distributed health information systems.
                                        The development and roll out of the national Health Patient Registration System (HPRS) by the NDoH and CSIR was a key game changer in improving the quality of identifying data that could be used for linkage.
                                    </li>

                                        Develop the patterns for data consolidation and integration, curation, common terminologies and find ways of processing that data that would best support operations.
                                        The Western Cape province had a head start in providing aspects of this functionality through the Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC)
                                        and would serve as the innovation incubator for the data integration and maturing of technologies, architecture, workflows, and data
                                        science approaches that could then be easily transferable nationally and regionally.

                                        Develop interfaces that could be used by multiple systems in the future that are Open and standards compliant.
                                        This was in line with the national health informations space where the country had published normative standards for interoperability (specifically for the HIV and TB program)

                                The unique value of the AHIE approach is in not relying on one single megalithic electronic medical record system for everything.
                                Large EMR systems present challenges, both for lack of coverage and delays in achieving that coverage, as well as supply chain issues with large IT systems.
                                An interoperability approach, which attempts to leverage whatever data is there and then improve upon it, often stands a better chance of success, largely due to the data being made available a lot earlier
                                than if waiting for maturity of a monolithic system.

                                An unexpected initiative presented when Covid-19 became a healthcare crisis.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-spacedparagraph">
                                Since COVID-19 is a notifiable medical condition with statutory requirements for reporting to government, there was an urgent need to rapidly consolidate data
                                from a range of different sources and, most importantly, onboard private healthcare data into a single environment with the public healthcare data.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-spacedparagraph">
                                At the start of the Covid-19 crisis the PHDC and the SPV were already in place as an existing data centre, with all the patterns developed for integrating and ingesting data.
                                In support were people with the right data competence, who could rapidly adapt to this challenge.
                            </p>
                            <p class="about-spacedparagraph">
                                This enabled the creation of an end-to-end information system which integrated the various laboratory, hospitalisation and mortality data into a Covid-19 system.
                                It included a workflow to support track and trace, without the need for a separate system, which simply leveraged current information from other healthcare contacts.

                                Research questions around Covid-19, such as how HIV and TB impact severe Covid-19 presentations and associated mortality, were able to be answered because of this.
                            </p>

                            <p class="about-spacedparagraph">
                                The model already in place also made it possible to rapidly integrate across multiple systems. An example was the ability to hand-off information to a call centre and have their findings integrated back into the consolidated environment.
                                Integration of data from the national track and trace system, which SMSed people their results and engaged them in bidirectional cellphone-based contact with the national Department of Health, is another example.

                            <p class="about-spacedparagraph">
                                This was a pressure test of the environment and helped to solidify and evolve the end-to-end function.
